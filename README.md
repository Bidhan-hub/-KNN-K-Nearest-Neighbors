K Nearest Neighbors Classification with python Code
After applying the KNN classifier on the Iris dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of around 97–100% (depending on the random train-test split), which means that nearly all test samples were correctly classified into their respective species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. The confusion matrix confirms this: the diagonal values represent correct predictions, and almost all samples fall on the diagonal, indicating high model performance. Very few misclassifications (if any) appear off the diagonal, usually between versicolor and virginica, since their features can sometimes overlap slightly. The classification report further quantifies performance for each class, showing high precision (few false positives), recall (few false negatives), and F1-scores close to 1, which confirms that the KNN model reliably predicts all three species. Overall, this demonstrates that KNN is very effective on the Iris dataset when using all four features (sepal and petal lengths and widths).
